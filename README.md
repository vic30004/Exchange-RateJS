# Tech Used

For this project, I used HTLM, CSS, and JS. Also, I used the exchangerate-api to get the rates for each currency.

# How it works

This application is very easy to use. The applications default currency is set to USD. Once you update the amount, the application will automatically convert the amount to the second currency and will display the result.
